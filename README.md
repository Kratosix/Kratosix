MY DISCORD IS Bit#1956

MY REDDIT IS KRATOSIX(WITH 309 KARMA)

I haven't been coding for a long time but what I'd say is that its not that complicated as it looks and the more you learn it, the more you'll understand the concepts. I didn't understand how functions work when I was 13, but now I practiced and I am further from that.

<p>In conclusion, programming is a skill just like any other. The more you practice the better you get.</p>


THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WRITTING THIS MUCH. üíÄ

<p>Projects I did were my site which Is still in development but I launched the prototype.
I also made a discord bot with discord.py and I am going to launch it on March 09th 2023 same time as the website(final)</p>
